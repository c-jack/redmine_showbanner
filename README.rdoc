= ShowBanner plugin for Redmine

Allows a banner to be displayed at the top of each page within a project, with an accompanying 'warning' style.

A custom field scoped to 'project' must be added with the name 'Banner' for this to work.

The banner will only show on projects with a value for the custom field 'Banner' on a project scope.
